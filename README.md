# CaptureTheQR

Our goal is to create a mobile application that allows us to hunt for the coolest QR codes that score the most points. Players will run around scanning QR codes, barcodes, etc. trying to find the ones that give them the most points.

We want users to compete with each other for the highest scoring QR codes, the most QR codes, the highest sum of QR codes, or highest scoring QR codes in a region. 

When a player scans a QR code they will have the option to take a photo of what or where the QR code is and also record the geolocation of the QR code. 

On a map, players can see local QR codes that other players have scanned.

## This repo is a work in progress: the wiki and README will be updated as we continue to work on this
